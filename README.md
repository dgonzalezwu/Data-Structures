# Data-Structures
A collection of software projects made during a course that focused on abstract data structures and their implementations.

## Lab-1 
An algorithm that solves a puzzle problem and prints the solution. The puzzle problem consists of  a chessboard of NxN specified size and N queens with the goal of placing the queens in an orientation where no two queens attack each other. 

## Lab-2
Created a fully functioning calculator where any fractional or arithmetic expressions can be inputted directly and it will display the solution. 

## Lab-3
Produced an program that parsed through test data in a text file, analyzed it, and displayed words that may be misspelled to help decrease the amount of potential errors in a text file. 

## Lab-4
Created an algorithm that performed multiple bank simulations using the given data set in order to determine the necessary amount of bank tellers needed.

## Lab-5
Created a binary search tree and included test cases to demonstrate its full functionality. 

## Lab-6
A data compression algorithm that reduces the amount of data that the inputted text requires.
